                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Sylvia Ortega, and I am a driven marketing student with a strong interest in combining creative strategy with data-driven decision-making to build impactful brand experiences. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Business Marketing at Juniata College, I’ve developed a foundation in marketing principles, consumer behavior, and campaign planning. I am especially passionate about applying these skills in the financial services industry—particularly within investment firms—where I can help expand their market reach through consumer analytics and strategic market research. I am excited by the potential to use marketing as a tool to communicate complex financial services in a clear, accessible, and engaging way. My goal is to contribute to a team where innovation, insight, and integrity drive measurable results.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Outside of academics and professional goals, I find joy in staying active, exploring new places, and spending quality time with family. Running is one of my favorite ways to clear my mind and stay energized, while traveling allows me to experience different cultures and gain new perspectives. I also deeply value time with loved ones, as it keeps me grounded and reminds me of what truly matters. These hobbies not only bring balance to my life but also inspire creativity and resilience—qualities I bring into everything I do, including my work in marketing.</p>
    
        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <p>My educational journey has been both creative and business-focused, providing me with a well-rounded foundation for a career in marketing. I began at the Creative and Performing Arts High School (CAPA) in Philadelphia, where I cultivated a strong appreciation for artistic expression, collaboration, and storytelling. Building on that creative background, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Marketing at Juniata College. Through my coursework, I’ve gained a solid understanding of marketing strategy, consumer behavior, and data analysis, along with hands-on experience in team projects and presentations. This combination of artistic insight and analytical thinking has shaped the way I approach problem-solving and communication, and continues to fuel my passion for developing impactful marketing strategies.</p>
