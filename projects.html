        <h2>Writing Projects</h2>
        <p>I have worked on a variety of writing projects, including blog posts, academic papers, and creative content. One notable project was an in-depth research paper on consumer behavior in the digital age, which required strong analytical skills and a clear, engaging writing style.</p>
        <p>Another project involved creating content for a non-profit organizationâ€™s website, where I had to ensure the tone was both informative and persuasive to attract donors. My ability to adapt writing styles for different purposes has been a key strength in my work.</p>

    <div id="course" class="content">
        <h2>Course Experience</h2>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey at Juniata College, I have taken courses that have sharpened my marketing knowledge and writing abilities. Notable courses include Digital Marketing, Consumer Psychology, and Marketing Research.</p>
        <p>In the Digital Marketing course, I led a project where I researched and developed a marketing strategy for a startup, incorporating both traditional and digital channels to increase brand visibility and consumer engagement. The project involved strong data analysis and creative problem-solving skills.</p>

    <div id="social" class="content">
        <h2>Social Media Management</h2>
        <p>As part of my social media management experience, I have helped small businesses grow their online presence. One of my major achievements was managing a restaurant's social media accounts, where I increased their follower count by 40% in six months through targeted campaigns, content creation, and audience engagement.</p>
        <p>I am proficient in tools like Hootsuite and Canva, which I use to schedule posts, track analytics, and create visually appealing content. I am passionate about how social media can help brands connect with their audiences and build lasting relationships.</p>
